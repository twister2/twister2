Twister2 is a big data tool kit supporting different parallel computing 
paradigms for big data applications. Twister2 models a parallel computation as a graph. Depending on the requirements the graph can be deployed, executed with different choices making Twister2 capable of running different applications including classic parallel computing, data parallel, streaming or function as a service applications.
